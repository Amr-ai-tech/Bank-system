A program that simulates a bank system, as it performs most of the basic functions, such as adding a client, searching for a client, deleting a client, and other basic functions, as clients are stored in a file and are dealt with through it.
Local librarys were used that I had previously completed myself.
warning : 
This project is not complete yet, and classes will be added that include the terminal U-I functions.
